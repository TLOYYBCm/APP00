# APP00
APP00 is the first attempt to create an EPM Solution in Google Workspace

1st ideas:
- use GSheet as a Database but keeping in mind other Database are possible. Clients should be able to choose
- get inspired from Tidemark Modelling : Metrics & Dimensions
- keep Workflows very simple: o
- - one user is the Process Owner, like an Admin Person : define the Process, the User Roles
- - other users collects the data, 
- - other users approcves/reject, 
- - other users can view/observe the Process
